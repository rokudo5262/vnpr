# bbPress - Moderation Tools

Moderation Tools extends bbPress to give you more control over your forums by adding rules that can automatically detect spam from users and bots. Topics and replies held for moderation are marked as pending, ready for your Moderators and Administrators to approve or unapprove. Once a user has at least one approved post a flag is set to trust their future posts, depending on the settings you choose.

All settings can be found in the bbPress settings page (Settings > Forums).
