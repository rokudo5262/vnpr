Award points based on WooCommerce purchase's total.

== Description ==

GamiPress - WooCommerce Points Per Purchase Total let's you award a percent of the [WooCommerce](http://wordpress.org/plugins/woocommerce/ "WooCommerce") purchase total as [GamiPress](http://wordpress.org/plugins/gamipress/ "GamiPress") points.

In addition, you can configure the percent of the purchase total to award. A few examples:

* A 100% will award the same purchase total as points (e.g. $40 = 40 points).
* A 200% will award the double of the purchase total as points (e.g. $40 = 80 points).
* A 50% will award the half of the purchase total as points (e.g. $40 = 20 points).

Also, you can enable and configure it per points type so you will be able to award a 100% of the purchase total for a specific points type and a 200% for another points type.
